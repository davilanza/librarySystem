Final project from the programing logic subject, first semester of computer engineering. The whole code is in the single .c file.
The assigned project mas a library system that could register users, books, reservations (linking both users and books, and also, avoiding conflicts such as two users reserving a book for the same date) and the possibility to consult any of this information. This project includes only three C libraries and was designed to improve clean code, syntax and programing principles. The main resources used were pointers and structs, that were vital to implement the linked list, program's core, since both users, books and reservations are linked by this structure.
Apart from its internal structure, a switch implements a simple menu controlled via terminal that show the user options to create, delete and modify variables.
